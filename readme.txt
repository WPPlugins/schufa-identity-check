This Plugin checks the Address Data of a WooCommerce Customer. If this check fails, no Order will be created.

== Description ==

This Plugin adds a WooCommerce Checkout Field in the Front-End for the Birthdate of a Customer.

Additional to this Plugin, a Contract with the SCHUFA and our Company is needed, to use this Plugin.

SCHUFA Identity Check is made to secure up your Orders and match german online shops with the new JuSchG, changed in April 2016 (E-Commerce with Cigars and Alcohol).

When a customer submits a new order, his typed personal data (first name, last name, street, birthdate, zipcode and city) will be sent to our servers, to

compare the typed in informations with our cached records. Only if the customer has never been checked, a request will be sent to the SCHUFA in germany and cached by us.

If the Customer has not been cached on our server https://baeker-it.de, a connection to the SCHUFA Server www.port.schufa.de/siml2 will be established from our API,

to cache the Customer Data in our Database so the customer will not be checked twice.

Your Access Data will be securly saved on our server to be available at any time - the needed yearly exchange of the certificate will be done by us for free.

IMPORTANT: This Plugin is only needed for E-Commerce Shops, which are selling to german Customers and currently not supporting other Countrys except germany.

Also you will need to purchase a License from https://identitaetscheck-plugin.de to use this Plugin.
